Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
The rules are simple.
You will be asked for your guess, it will need to be in x,y format ie 0,1 1,1 or 2,2
You can not exceed 2,2 (guesses are 0 indexed.) meaning there are 3 values per coordinate [0-2,0-2] in that format.
Anything out of that range and you will be asked to reinput your choice.
The board will be printed each turn so you can see the most up to date game board.
Have fun and may the best person win!
