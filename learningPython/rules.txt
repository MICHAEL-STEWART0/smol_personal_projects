Welcome to the guessing game. In this game there are a couple of rules.
There is a bot that will choose a number at you have to guess what it is. 
The range is from 1-100 inclusive.
You will be asked to guess a number, if it is not within the permitted range, you will see "OUT OF BOUNDS".
On your first turn  if your  guess is within 10 of the target num you will see "warm".
if it is furter than 10 away from the number, you will see "cold".
on all other turns if a guess is closer to the number than the previous guess you will see warmer, or colder.
when your guess the number correctly I will let you know that youve guessed correctly, and how many tries it took you.
