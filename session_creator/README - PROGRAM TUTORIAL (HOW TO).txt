if this were a normal build  built by pyinstaller these instructions would be true. the file is left unbuilt to avoid leaking any sensitive system information.

In the dist folder there should be another folder called create_sessions,open it and in that folder you will see a create_sessions.exe, double click that in order to run the program.

STEPS TO RUN PROGRAM:
1) open the dist folder
2) open the create_sessions folder
3) in the locator_ids.txt file make sure you have loaded your locator ids into it, list 1 locatorid perline like this

123456
123456
123456
123456
123456
123456

this would be how the format would be if you were to have 6 locator ids.

4) run the create_sessions.exe program
5) read the instructions in the terminal, and follow them.
6) the program will run and create your sessions. When the terminal closes is when your sessions are done being created. you can now go and view your sessions in the talent center.
