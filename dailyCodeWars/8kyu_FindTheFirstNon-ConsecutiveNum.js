/*Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too! */

function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    //grab each element in to the arr and 1 to its sum, if that value strictly equals the next
    //element in the array it would return true. So IF the value returns false we know that
    //number array is not consecutive so return that element of the array.
    if ((arr[i] + 1 === arr[i + 1]) === false) {
      return arr[i + 1];
    }
  }
  return null; // if there is no false value indicating that all numbers are non consecutive return null
}

firstNonConsecutive([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]); // function call for testing.
